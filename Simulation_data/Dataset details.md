# Dataset details

The dataset includes six .mat files, from **buckSimulation_0** to **buckSimulation_6**. They correspond to the testing cases in the Table II in the paper, i.e., clean data, ADC error, Sync error, 5 noise, 10 noise, ADC-Sync-5noise, ADC-Sync-10noise.

The datasets are generated by using the Buck converter model implemented in Matlab, which can be found in the folder "Code"
